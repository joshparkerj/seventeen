Do you like green eggs and ham? I do not like them Sam I Am.


I do not like them from a box. I do not like them with a fox.
I do not like them here nor there. I do not like them anywhere!
I do not like green eggs and ham. I do not like them, Sam I Am.

Try them, try them and you may! Try them and you may I say!

I can eat green eggs and ham. I can eat them on the lam!
