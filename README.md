Do you like green eggs and ham? I do not like them Sam I Am.


I do not like them from a box. I do not like them with a fox.
I do not like them here nor there. I do not like them anywhere!
I do not like green eggs and ham. I do not like them, Sam I Am.

Try them, try them and you may! Try them and you may I say!

Do you like them with a bear? Do you like them in your hair?
Do you like them on the porch? I can make them with a torch!
I can make them whipped and fried. When Bush lied, a million died!

You've got problems, Sam I Am. Faded on green eggs and ham?
